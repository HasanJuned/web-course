  <br>
    
      <p>This is Hasan Ahmed, a Flutter mobile application developer from Sylhet, Bangladesh. Currently working as a Co-Instructor of Flutter at Ostad since August 2023 (remotely). I will complete my BSc in CSE from Leading University, Sylhet in 2025.</p>
      <p>In Ostad, my task is to teach students about Flutter, Firebase, Rest API, and assist them with their projects. Throughout my professional and student life, I have been skilled in Flutter app development and have made projects like ‘Crafty Bay, Food App, Task Manager’. I have also completed an online course on Flutter and am certified at Ostad. Additionally, I make YouTube tutorials on Dart, OOP, and Flutter (Bangla).</p>
      <p>Based on my experience, I believe I am the right fit for a position as a Flutter developer. If given the opportunity, I would be grateful to showcase my talent and skills. Please find my attached CV for more detailed information about my career history and extra-curricular activities. If your company needs a Flutter mobile application developer, intern, or junior software engineer for an onsite job, I am interested in working. You can also reach out to me in the future if there are no such posts available.</p>
